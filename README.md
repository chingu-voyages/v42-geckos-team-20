## OVERVIEW
Nearby Market is an e-commerce app which connects buyers with sellers locally. Its purpose is to make it easier to sell used items and to find good deals when buying second-hand.

## USERS
### Account creation:
As a user of this app you are either a buyer or seller. Anyone can browse what sellers have put up for sale on the site without creating an account. However, to get in touch with the seller or to save items to a 'shopping cart' it is necessary to create a password secured profile. This facilitates communication as buyers aren't required to make their email, phone number or address public. Additionally buyers and sellers can rate each other and having an account is necessary to allow this option. 

Buyers need to create a profile in order to post things for sale. 

### Buying:
Items can be viewed... 
* by category (clothing, furniture, electronics, etc...), 
* by type (sofas, chairs, tables, etc..), 
* by seller (Marcos_nos√©que, Ibrahim_seller, Jane_doe, etc..)

Buyers can add items to a cart as a way to 'save for later'. 
The app doesn't support purchasing online. Instead users connect over the app and agree how to organize picking up the items (usually at the sellers address). Each item has the option to contact the seller and a map with seller's approximate location.

Once buyer and seller are in contact it is up to them to agree time and place to pick up the purchase and best form of payment (usually cash).

### Selling:
Items can be posted with an image, price, brief description and labels. Labels help make it easier to find items through filtered searches. Labels match the 'categories' and 'types'. 

### Rating:
Buyers and sellers can rate each other based on their experience with one another. The idea here is that if users are less than honest or otherwise unpleasant they will be sanctioned by the community (though they can always create a new profile).


## DEVELOPMENT
---

## This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
